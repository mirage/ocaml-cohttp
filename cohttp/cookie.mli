(** Functions for the HTTP Cookie and Set-Cookie header fields.
    Using the Set-Cookie header field, an HTTP server can pass name/value
    pairs and associated metadata (called cookies) to a user agent.  When
    the user agent makes subsequent requests to the server, the user
    agent uses the metadata and other information to determine whether to
    return the name/value pairs in the Cookie header. *)
