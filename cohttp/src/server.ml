  (** A request handler can respond in two ways:

      - Using [`Response], with a {!Response.t} and a {!body}.
      - Using [`Expert], with a {!Response.t} and an IO function that is
        expected to write the response body. The IO function has access to the
        underlying {!IO.ic} and {!IO.oc}, which allows writing a response body
        more efficiently, stream a response or to switch protocols entirely
        (e.g. websockets). Processing of pipelined requests continue after the
        [unit IO.t] is resolved. The connection can be closed by closing the
        {!IO.ic}. *)

      with the given [status] code and response [body]. If [flush] is true, then
      every response chunk will be flushed to the network rather than being
      buffered. [flush] is true by default. The transfer encoding will be
      detected from the [body] value and set to chunked encoding if it cannot be
      determined immediately. You can override the encoding by supplying an
      appropriate [Content-length] or [Transfer-encoding] in the [headers]
      parameter. *)
