    duplicated header can not have multiple values, only the last value is kept
    in place. Otherwise, the values are concatenated and place at the first
    position the header is encountered in [h].

    Already concatenated values (like [anhost.com, anotherhost.com] in the
    example below) are not affected by [clean_dup]. For example,

    {v
    transfer-encoding: gzip
    host: afirsthost.com
    connection: keep-alive
    host: anhost.com, anotherhost.com
    transfer-encoding: chunked

    becomes

    {v
    transfer-encoding: gzip, chunked
    connection: keep-alive
    host: anhost.com, anotherhost.com
    v}

    Finally, following {{:https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230#section-3.2.2}
    RFC7230ยง3.2.2}, the header [Set-cookie] is treated as an exception and
    ignored by [clean_dup]. *)
