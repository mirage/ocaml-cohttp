(** [init ?ctx ?resolver ()] is a network context that is the same as the
    {!default_ctx}, but with either the connection handling or resolution module
    overridden with [ctx] or [resolver] respectively. This is useful to supply a
    {!Conduit_lwt_unix.resolver} with a custom source network interface, or a
    {!Resolver_lwt.t} with a different name resolution strategy (for instance to
    override a hostname to point it to a Unix domain socket). *)

(** [connect_uri ~ctx uri] starts a {i flow} on the given [uri]. The choice of
    the protocol (with or without encryption) is done by the {i scheme} of the
    given [uri]:

    - If the scheme is [https], we will {b extend} [ctx] to be able to start a
      TLS connection with a default TLS configuration (no authentication) on the
      default or user-specified port.
    - If the scheme is [http], we will {b extend} [ctx] to be able to start a
      simple TCP/IP connection on the default or user-specified port.

    These extensions have the highest priority ([Conduit] will try to initiate a
    communication with them first). By {i extension}, we mean that the user is
    able to fill its own [ctx] and we don't overlap resolution functions from
    the given [ctx]. *)
