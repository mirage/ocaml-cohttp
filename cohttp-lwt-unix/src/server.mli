(** The [Server] module implements the full UNIX HTTP server interface,
    including the UNIX-specific functions defined in {!S}.

    The {!Logs} source name for this module logger is ["cohttp.lwt.server"].
    Refer to the {!Debug} module for further details. *)

(** [create ?timeout ?backlog ?stop ?on_exn ?mode t] is a new HTTP server.

    The user can decide to start a simple HTTP server (without encryption) or
    one with TLS encryption. It depends on what the user gives as [mode] and how
    [conduit-unix] is configured.

    To create a simple HTTP server listening on port 8089:

    {[
      let run = create (`TCP 8080)
    ]}

    When provided, the [stop] thread will terminate the server if it ever
    becomes determined.

    When provided, [backlog] will limit the number of open connections.

    Every connection will be served in a new lightweight thread that is invoked
    via the callback defined in [t]. If the callback raises an exception, it is
    passed to [on_exn] (by default, to a function that logs the exception using
    the {!Logs} library). *)
