description: """
This package contains some benchmarks for http and cohttp.
The benchmarks for the server latency will require wrk2
(https://github.com/giltene/wrk2) to run. The latency graphs
can then be generated with HdrHistogram plotter, also available
online at https://hdrhistogram.github.io/HdrHistogram/plotFiles.html."""
