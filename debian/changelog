ocaml-http (0.1.3-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * force bash as SHELL in Makefile, since we rely on bashisms
    (closes: bug#381915)
  * removed Http_daemon.{start,start'}, they have been deprecated a while ago
    in favour of Http_daemon.main
  * added 'auto_close' to daemon specifications. When set to true (defaults to
    false), makes ocaml-http close every connection with client just after
    having executed a callback, no matter if that callback succeeds or fails
    with an exception
