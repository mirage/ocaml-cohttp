(** HTTP Authentication and Authorization header parsing and generation *)

(** HTTP authentication challenge types *)
type challenge = [
 | `Basic of string (** Basic authentication within a realm *)
] with sexp

(** HTTP authorization credential types *)
type credential = [
  | `Basic of string * string
  (** Basic authorization with a username and password *)
  | `Other of string
  (** An unknown credential type that will be passed straight through
      to the application layer *)
] with sexp

(** [string_of_credential] converts the {!credential} to a string compatible
    with the HTTP/1.1 wire format for authorization credentials ("responses") *)
val string_of_credential : credential -> string

(** [credential_of_string cred_s] converts an HTTP response to an
    authentication challenge into a {!credential}.  If the credential is not
    recognized, [`Other cred_s] is returned. *)
val credential_of_string : string -> credential

(** [string_of_challenge challenge] converts the {!challenge} to a string
    compatible with the HTTP/1.1 wire format for authentication challenges.

    For example, a [`Basic] challenge with realm ["foo"] will be
    marshalled to ["Basic realm=foo"], which can then be combined
    with a [www-authenticate] HTTP header and sent back to the
    client.  There is a helper function {!Header.add_authorization_req}
    that does just this. *)
