## Unreelased

- Completely new IO & Parsing layers (@anuragsoni #819)
  + Cohttp now uses an optimized parser for requests and responses.
  + The new IO layer produces much less temporary buffers.

## v5.0.0 (2021-12-15)

- Cohttp.Header: new implementation (lyrm #747)

  + New implementation of Header modules using an associative list instead of a map, with one major semantic change (function ```get```, see below), and some new functions (```clean_dup```, ```get_multi_concat```)
  + More Alcotest tests as well as fuzzing tests for this particular module.

  ### Purpose

  The new header implementation uses an associative list instead of a map to represent headers and is focused on predictability and intuitivity: except for some specific and documented functions, the headers are always kept in transmission order, which makes debugging easier and is also important for [RFC7230§3.2.2](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230#section-3.2.2) that states that multiple values of a header must be kept in order.

  Also, to get an intuitive function behaviour, no extra work to enforce RFCs is done by the basic functions. For example, RFC7230§3.2.2 requires that a sender does not send multiple values for a non list-value header. This particular rule could require the ```Header.add``` function to remove previous values of non-list-value headers, which means some changes of the headers would be out of control of the user. With the current implementation, an user has to actively call dedicated functions to enforce such RFCs (here ```Header.clean_dup```).

  ### Semantic changes
  Two functions have a semantic change : ```get``` and ```update```.

  #### get
  ```get``` was previously doing more than just returns the value associated to a key; it was also checking if the searched header could have multiple values: if not, the last value associated to the header was returned; otherwise, all the associated values were concatenated and returned. This semantics does not match the global idea behind the new header implementation, and would also be very inefficient.

  + The new ```get``` function only returns the last value associated to the searched header.
  + ```get_multi_concat``` function has been added to get a result similar to the previous ```get``` function.

  #### update
  ```update``` is a pretty new function (#703) and changes are minor and related to ```get``` semantic changes.

  + ```update h k f``` is now modifying only the last occurrences of the header ```k``` instead of all its occurrences.
  + a new function ```update_all``` function has been added and work on all the occurrences of the updated header.

  ### New functions :

  + ```clean_dup```  enables the user to clean headers that follows the {{:https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230#section-3.2.2} RFC7230§3.2.2} (no duplicate, except ```set-cookie```)
  + ```get_multi_concat``` has been added to get a result similar to the previous ```get``` function.

## v3.0.0 - aborted

## v2.5.5 (2021-03-15)

- `Cohttp_async.resolve_local_file`, `Cohttp_lwt.resolve_local_file` and `Cohttp_lwt_unix.resolve_file`
  are now the same code under the hood (`Cohttp.Path.resolve_local_file`). The old names
  have been preserved for compatibility, but will be marked as deprecated in the next release. This
  changes the behavior of `Cohttp_lwt_unix.resolve_file`: it now percent-decodes the paths and blocks
  escaping from the docroot correctly. This also fixes and tests the corner cases in these methods
  when the docroot is empty. (ewanmellor #755)

## v2.5.4 (2020-07-21)

- cohttp: a change in #694 modified the semantics of Header.replace.
  The semantics change is reverted, and a new Header.update function
  is introduced, following the semantics of Map.update. (#702 mseri)
- cohttp: reimplement update to support compilers that are older than
  OCaml 4.06 (#703 mseri)

## v2.5.3 (2020-06-27)

- cohttp-async: adapt to async >= v0.14 (#699 copy)

## v2.5.2 (2020-06-27)

- cohttp, cohttp-async: correctly set host header for unix domain sockets,
  implement Unix domain socket support for cohttp-async (#698 Leonidas-from-XIV)
- cohttp: better body encoding management when creating request and
  response, and correction of Header.replace function (#694 lyrm)

## v2.5.1 (2020-02-18)

- cohttp-lwt: pass ctx through HEAD client requests (#689 hannesm)

## v2.5.0 (2019-12-17)

- cohttp-lwt-jsoo: support js_of_ocaml 3.5.0 and higher (avsm)

## v2.4.0 (2019-11-08)

- mirage: adapt to new mirage interfaces: mirage-flow 2.0.0,
  mirage-channel 4.0.0, mirage-kv 3.0.0 (#678 hannesm)
- async: use Pipe.singleton instead of Pipe.of_list as it is more efficient
  (#677 smuenzel-js)

## v2.3.0 (2019-08-18)

- use conduit-mirage instead of mirage-conduit, which was renamed
  upstream in conduit. The minimum OCaml version supported for
  conduit-mirage is now OCaml 4.07 and higher. (#672 avsm)
- remove deprecation warnings in OCaml 4.08.0 using stdlib-shims (#672 avsm)
- async: do not read body if none is present (#671 emillon)

## v2.2.0 (2019-07-20)

- Previously if the client closed the connection while cohttp was
  handling a request, the server would crash (by default, unless the
  user overrode that using `on_exn` or changing Lwt's async exception
  handler). Now, cohttp will just log this at `info` level and
  continue. Exceptions produced by user code are logged as errors,
  while other exceptions generated by cohttp call back to the conduit
  exception handler, as before. (#669 talex5)

## v2.1.3 (2019-07-12)

- support uri.3.0.0 that has optional sexp support (#668 avsm)
- use re.1.9.0 api to remove deprecation warnings (#664 vbmithr)

## v2.1.2 (2019-04-09)

- cohttp: handle empty cookie components gracefully without raising
  an exception (#663 martinslota)

## v2.1.1 (2019-04-05)

- `cohttp-mirage`: remove dependency on the `result` module
  (#662 hannesm)

## v2.1.0 (2019-03-01)

- `cohttp-mirage`: update to the newest `Mirage_kv.RO` API

## v2.0.0 (2019-02-04)

Compatibility breaking interface changes:

Async: Expert response action no longer writes empty HTTP body (#647 by andreas)

In cohttp.0.99, a number of subpackages were turned into explicit
opam packages to simplify dependency management.
To aid migration, some compatability shims were left in place so that
the old findlib names would continue to work. They have now been removed
as of this release.  If you were still using them, then please rename
them as follows:
- `cohttp.lwt-core` -> `cohttp-lwt`
- `cohttp.lwt` -> `cohttp-lwt-unix`
- `cohttp.js` -> `cohttp-lwt-jsoo`
- `cohttp.async` -> `cohttp-async`

  (#589, ansiwen)

## v1.0.0 (2017-11-16)

* opam: rename `mirage-http` to `cohttp`-mirage` (#572)
* cohttp-lwt{,-unix}: wrap the libraries in top-level modules (#568)

* fix compatibility with OCaml 4.06 and `-safe-string` (#580, #581)

## v0.99.0 (2017-07-12)

Port build to jbuilder, and break up OPAM packages into multiple
independent packages instead of being optional dependencies against
the main `cohttp` package. This makes it significantly easier to
depend on precisely the libraries you need, but requires porting
applications to use the new `ocamlfind` and `opam` scheme.

The new package layout is:

- `cohttp`: the main `Cohttp` module
- `cohttp-lwt`: the portable Lwt implementation
- `cohttp-lwt-unix`: the Lwt/Unix implementation
- `cohttp-lwt-jsoo`: the js-of-ocaml JavaScript implementation
- `cohttp-async`: the Jane Street Async implementation
- `mirage-http`: the MirageOS compatible implementation
- `cohttp-top`: a toplevel printer for the Cohttp types.

In each of these packages, the `opam` and `ocamlfind` package
names are now _the same_, so you will need to rename the former
subpackages such as `cohttp.async` to `cohttp-async`.  The
implementation is otherwise the same, so no other code changes
should be required.

In return for these breaking changes to the packaging, it is
now significantly easier to depend on a particular backend,
also for us to rev the interfaces towards a stable 1.0 release.
Jbuilder also builds the source tree around 4x faster than it
did previously.

A number of deprecation warnings have been added to the source
tree as well to mark the interfaces that will be removed in 1.0.
These are `Cohttp_lwt.{Client,Server,Net}`, and a `Cohttp_lwt.Body`
alias was added to deprecate the direct use of `Cohttp_lwt_body`.
This will let us unify the namespaces of all the packages to use
a single top-level module for each package in the future.

Most of the release and packaging work here was done by rgrinberg
and avsm.

0.15.1 (2015-01-10):
* Lwt 2.4.7 renamed `blit_bytes_string` to `blit_to_bytes`, so depend
  on the newer API now. (#230)
* Use `cmdliner` in all of the Lwt client and server binaries.  This gives

  can be viewed with the `--help` option. (#218 via Runhang Li)
* Improve `oasis` constraints and regenerate `opam` file (#229 via
  Christophe Troestler).

0.15.0 (2014-12-24):

Compatibility breaking interface changes:
* Change `Cohttp_lwt_body.map` to use a non-labelled type to fit the Lwt
  style better (#200).
* Depend on Base64 version 2, which uses `B64` as the toplevel module name (#220).

New features and bug fixes:
* Remove use of deprecated `Lwt_unix.run` and replace it with `Lwt_main.run`.
  Should be no observable external change (#217).
* Improve ocamldoc of `Cohttp.S` signature (#221).

0.14.0 (2014-12-18):

Compatibility breaking interface changes:
* Simplify the Lwt server signature, so that manual construction of
  a `callback` is no longer required (#210).
  Code that previous looked like:

```
   let conn_closed (_,conn_id) () = <...>
   let config = { Server.callback; conn_closed } in
```

should now be:

```
   let conn_closed (_,conn_id) = <...>
   let config = Server.make ~callback ~conn_closed () in
```

* Remove the `Cohttp.Base64` module in favour of the external `base64`
  library (which is now a new dependency).

New features and bug fixes:
* Lwt `respond_error` now defaults to an internal server error if no
  status code is specified (#212).
* Modernise the `opam` file using the OPAM 1.2 workflow (#211).
* Flush the response body to the network by default, rather than
  buffering by default.  The `?flush` optional parameter can still
  be explicitly set to false if flushing is not desired (#205).

0.13.0 (2014-12-05):

Compatibility breaking interface changes:

* Add sexp converters for Conduit contexts and `Lwt` client and server
  modules and module types.

New features and bug fixes:
* Can use the Conduit 0.7+ `CONDUIT_TLS=native` environment variable to
  make HTTPS requests using the pure OCaml TLS stack instead of depending
  on OpenSSL bindings.  All of the installed binaries (client and server)
  can work in this mode.
* Add `Cohttp_lwt_unix_debug` which lets libraries control the debugging
  output from Cohttp.  Previously the only way to do this was to set the
  `COHTTP_DEBUG` environment variable at the program start.
* Add `cohttp-curl-lwt` as a lightweight URI fetcher from the command-line.
  It uses the `cmdliner` as a new dependency.
* Remove build dependency check on `lwt.ssl` for `cohttp.lwt`.
  This has been moved to conduit, so only `lwt.unix` is needed here now.

0.12.0 (2014-11-07):

Compatibility breaking interface changes:

* Rename `Cohttp.Auth.t` to `Cohttp.Auth.credential` and `Cohttp.Auth.req`
  to `Cohttp.Auth.challenge`.  Also expose an `Other` variant
  to make it more extensible for unknown authentication types. The
  `Cohttp.Auth` functions using these types have also been renamed accordingly.
* Rename `Cohttp.Transfer.encoding_to_string` to `string_of_encoding`
  for consistency with the rest of Cohttp's APIs.
* The `has_body` function in the Request and Response modules now
  explicitly signals when the body size is unknown.
* Move all the module type signatures into `Cohttp.S`.
* If users have percent-encoded file names, their resolution is changed:
 `resolve_local_file` in `Cohttp_async` and `Cohttp_lwt` now always
  percent-decode paths (#157)
* Remove the `Cohttp_lwt.Server.server` type synonym to `t`.
* When reading data from a HTTP body stream using the `Fixed` encoding,
  we need to maintain state (bytes remaining) so we know when to finish.
  The `Cohttp.Request` and `Cohttp.Response` interfaces now expose a
  `reader` and `writer` types to track this safely.
* Add `is_empty` function to the `Cohttp.S.Body` module type.
* Add `Strings` representation to `Cohttp.Body` to efficiently hold a
  list of body chunks.
* Move flushing logic for HTTP bodies into the portable `Request` and
  `Response` modules instead of individual Lwt and Async backends.
* Port module interfaces to the latest Conduit (0.6.0+) API.
* Cohttp requires OCaml 4.01.0 or higher now.

New features and bugfixes:

* Add a `Cohttp_lwt_xhr` JavaScript backend that enables Cohttp logic to be
  mapped to `XMLHTTPRequest` in browsers via `js_of_ocaml` (via Andy Ray).
* Add a `Cohttp.String_io` and `String_io_lwt` module that uses OCaml
  `string` or `Buffer.t` to read and write HTTP requests and responses
  instead of network connections.
* `cohttp_server_lwt` and `cohttp_server_async` now return better errors (#158)
* `cohttp_server_lwt` and `cohttp_server_async` now serve indexes directly (#162)
* [lwt] Add `stop` thread to terminate a running server if it finishes (#147).
* Add `Cohttp.Connection.compare` to make ordering of connections possible.
* Add `Body.map` and `Body.as_pipe` to work with HTTP bodies more easily.
* Remove link-time dependency on camlp4 via META fixes (#127).
* Support HTTP methods and versions other than the standard ones. (#142).
* Improve `cohttp_server_lwt` and `cohttp_server_async` directory listings (#158)
* Fix `Cohttp_async.resolve_local_file` directory traversal vulnerability (#158)
* [async] In the Async server, do not close the Reader too early.
* [async] Close file descriptors more eagerly in the HTTP client (#167).
* Reduce thread allocation by replacing `return <const>` with `return_none`,
  `return_unit` or `return_nil`.

0.11.2 (2014-04-21)
* Fix build by add a missing build-deps in _oasis.

0.11.1 (2014-04-17):
* Remove an errant async_ssl reference left in the _oasis file that is
  now handled by the Conduit library (#116).
* Add an Lwt-based SimpleHTTPServer equivalent as `cohttp-server-lwt` (#108).
* `Cohttp.Connection.t` now exposes sexp accessor functions (#117).

0.11.0 (2014-04-01):
* Remove dependency on `ocaml-re` in order to make library POSIX thread-safe.
* Shift most of the connection handling logic out to a Conduit library that
  worries about which SSL library to use, and fails if SSL is not available.
* Add Async-SSL support for both client and server (#102).
* Add Lwt-SSL support for the server side (the client side existed before).
* Fix buggy Async chunked POST handling.

0.10.0 (2014-03-02):
* Interface change: The `Request` and `Response` module types now explicitly
  signal `Eof` and `Invalid` (for errors), to help the backend distinguish them.
* Interface change: Unify HTTP body handling across backends into a `Cohttp.Body`
  module.  This is extended by Async/Lwt implementations with their specific
  ways of handling bodies (Pipes for Async, or Lwt_stream for Lwt).
* [lwt] Interface change: HTTP client calls now raise Lwt exceptions rather
  than return an option type.  This permits better error handling in Lwt.
* [lwt] Interface change: The `Server` callback now always provides a `body`
  argument, since `Cohttp_lwt_body` now explicitly supports empty bodys.
* Add `Cohttp.Header.is_keep_alive` to test if a connection should be reused.
* [lwt] Respect the `keep-alive` header in the server request handling.
* [async] Add a `Body` that takes a `Pipe` or a `string`, similarly to Lwt.
* Install `cohttp-server` binary even if tests are disabled.
* Begin an `examples` directory with some simple uses of the library.

0.9.16 (2014-01-30):

* Improve Travis tests to cover more upstream users of Cohttp.
* Refactor build flags to let the portable Lwt-core be built independently of Lwt.unix.

0.9.15 (2014-01-11):
* Remove `Cohttp_mirage` libraries, which have now moved to `mirage/mirage-http-*` on GitHub.

* Fix parsing of cookies with `=` in the values (#71).
* Add `Max-age` support for cookies (#70).
* Make the `Response` record fields mutable to match the `Request` (#67).
* Fix compilation with Async 109.58.00 (#77).
* Make Header handling case-insensitive (by forcing lowercase) (#75).
* Remove the `>>` operator as it was unused and had incorrect precedence (#79).

0.9.14 (2013-12-15):

0.9.8 (2013-05-24):
* Lwt interface change: Rewrite Lwt backends to share code, and remove duplicate function calls from Uri.
* Depend on `Uri` 1.3.8+ as it exposes the parameter query functions now removed from `Request`.
* Do not depend on Cstruct in core library, as only Mirage needs it.
* Remove `Cohttp_async.body` type alias and just use `string Pipe.Reader.t` for more explicit types.

0.9.7 (2013-05-10):
