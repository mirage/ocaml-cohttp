0.9.11 (trunk):
* Request module: When sending a request, add the port
information in the host header field if available.
* Request module: When parsing a request, add scheme, host and port
  information in the uri.
* TCP server: When creating the socket for the server, do not force
  PF_INET6 but take the sockaddr value.
* Add HTTP OPTIONS method.
* Use getaddrinfo instead of gethostbyname for DNS resolution.

0.9.10 (2013-06-21):
* Add `set-cookie` header extraction functions for clients that read cookies.
* Explicitly flush the debug output when the `COHTTP_DEBUG` env variable is set.
* [async] Add client head/post/patch/delete methods.
* [lwt] Client.head no longer returns a response body, just the metadata.
* [lwt] Do not send chunked encoding headers with GET/DELETE requests that have no body. 

0.9.9 (2013-06-12):
* Disable the mirage executable test as it was building too aggressively and breaking builds.

0.9.8 (2013-05-24):
* Lwt interface change: Rewrite Lwt backends to share code, and remove duplicate function calls from Uri.
* Depend on `Uri` 1.3.8+ as it exposes the parameter query functions now removed from `Request`.
* Do not depend on Cstruct in core library, as only Mirage needs it.
* Remove `Cohttp_async.body` type alias and just use `string Pipe.Reader.t` for more explicit types.

0.9.7 (2013-05-10):
* Attach a GC finaliser to the Lwt client to ensure that even an HTTP body isnt consumed, the socket will eventually be closed (#11).
* Add an Async.Server interface, and revise the Client interface to be more in line with Core standards.
* Add 422 Unprocessable Entity code.
* Refactor modules better across Lwt/Async, but incompatible with earlier releases for Async (Lwt is unchanged at present).
* Add user agent string and User-Agent header helper function
* The git history of this release is full of adventures in parameterised monads and refactoring, but this isn't in the actual release. Yet.

0.9.6 (2013-03-18):
* Depend on Async (>= 109.12.00), which has an incompatible API with earlier versions.
* Rearrange core library files for `obuild` support.

0.9.5 (2012-12-29):
* Fix cookie parsing to retrieve the correct header.
* Update to `mirage-net` 0.5.0 API (based on cstruct 0.6.0).

0.9.4 (2012-12-19):
* Add Lwt `respond_redirect` and `respond_need_auth` helpers.
* Add enough Basic authorization support to serve a password-protected website.
* Fix Lwt file serving to not throw exception on trying to serve a directory.
* Port Async interface to 108.07.00 or higher (incompatible
  with earlier versions).

0.9.3 (2012-10-27):
* Add basic cookie support back to the portable library.
* `Cohttp_lwt.Client.post_form` now uses non-chunked encoding for
  the POST instead of chunked.
* Various improvements and tests for the pipelined Lwt Client.callv
* If an Lwt callback does not consume a body, ensure it has
  been drained by the API to prevent future pipelines from stalls.
* Fix handling of Lwt server non-empty POST bodies.
* Map the `put` functions to HTTP PUT instead of POST.

0.9.2 (2012-09-20):
* Add Request.get_param to extract a singleton key from queries.
* Fix chunked encoding handling when short reads occur.
* Install HTML documentation for all enabled drivers.
* Use ocaml-uri-1.3.2 interface for query parsing.
* Lwt: Add Server.respond_file and resolve_file for the Unix
  library to make it easier to serve static files.
* Lwt: Server.respond_not_found takes an optional Uri.t now.

0.9.1 (2012-09-11):
* Functorise for Async, Lwt_unix and Mirage.
* Use URI and Re libraries to not need Str any more.
* More robust parsing for various HTTP headers.

0.9.0 (2012-08-01):
* Initial public release.
