0.12.0 (trunk):
* Remove link-time dependency on camlp4 via META fixes (#127).
* The `has_body` function in the Request and Response modules now
  explicitly signals when the body size is unknown, to help deal with
  broken HTTP 1.0 responses.
* Move all the module type signatures into `Cohttp.S`.
* [lwt] Remove the `Cohttp_lwt.Server.server` type synonym to `t`.

0.11.2 (2014-04-21)
* Fix build by add a missing build-deps in _oasis.

0.11.1 (2014-04-17):
* Remove an errant async_ssl reference left in the _oasis file that is
  now handled by the Conduit library (#116).
* Add an Lwt-based SimpleHTTPServer equivalent as `cohttp-server-lwt` (#108).
* `Cohttp.Connection.t` now exposes sexp accessor functions (#117).

0.11.0 (2014-04-01):
* Remove dependency on `ocaml-re` in order to make library POSIX thread-safe.
* Shift most of the connection handling logic out to a Conduit library that
  worries about which SSL library to use, and fails if SSL is not available.
* Add Async-SSL support for both client and server (#102).
* Add Lwt-SSL support for the server side (the client side existed before).
* Fix buggy Async chunked POST handling.

0.10.0 (2014-03-02):
* Interface change: The `Request` and `Response` module types now explictly
  signal `Eof` and `Invalid` (for errors), to help the backend distinguish them.
* Interface change: Unify HTTP body handling across backends into a `Cohttp.Body`
  module.  This is extended by Async/Lwt implementations with their specific
  ways of handling bodies (Pipes for Async, or Lwt_stream for Lwt).
* [lwt] Interface change: HTTP client calls now raise Lwt exceptions rather
  than return an option type.  This permits better error handling in Lwt.
* [lwt] Interface change: The `Server` callback now always provides a `body`
  argument, since `Cohttp_lwt_body` now explicitly supports empty bodys.
* Add `Cohttp.Header.is_keep_alive` to test if a connection should be reused.
* [lwt] Respect the `keep-alive` header in the server request handling.
* [async] Add a `Body` that takes a `Pipe` or a `string`, similarly to Lwt.
* Install `cohttp-server` binary even if tests are disabled.
* Begin an `examples` directory with some simple uses of the library.

0.9.16 (2014-01-30):
* Add some module type equalities in `Cohttp_lwt_unix` so that
  `Cohttp_lwt_unix.Server.Request.IO.ic` can be equivalen to `Lwt_io.input_channel`.
* Add sexp converters to most Cohttp types (#83).
* Improve Travis tests to cover more upstream users of Cohttp.
* Refactor build flags to let the portable Lwt-core be built independently of Lwt.unix.

0.9.15 (2014-01-11):
* Remove `Cohttp_mirage` libraries, which have now moved to `mirage/mirage-http-*` on GitHub.
* Add an "HTTP only" `Cookie` attribute (#69).
* Fix parsing of cookies with `=` in the values (#71).
* Add `Max-age` support for cookies (#70).
* Make the `Response` record fields mutable to match the `Request` (#67).
* Fix compilation with Async 109.58.00 (#77).
* Make Header handling case-insensitive (by forcing lowercase) (#75).
* Remove the `>>` operator as it was unused and had incorrect precedence (#79).

0.9.14 (2013-12-15):
* Install a `cohttp-server` binary that serves local directory contents via a web server (#54).
* Add a `flush` function to the `IO` module type and implement in Lwt/Async/Mirage.
* Add option `flush` support in the Async and Lwt responders (#52).
* Autogenerate HTTP codes from @citricsquid's JSON representation of the HTTP RFCs.
* Always set `TCP_NODELAY` for Lwt/Unix server sockets for low-latency responses (#58).
* Added a Server-Side Events test-case from the HTML5 Doctor. See `lib_test/README.md`.
* Async.Server response now takes an optional `body` rather than a mandatory `body option` (#62).
* Regenerate build system using OASIS 0.4.0.

0.9.13 (2013-12-10):
* The `cohttp.lwt-core` is now installed as an OS-independent Lwt library.
* Add support for Mirage 1.0, via `cohttp.mirage-unix` and `cohttp.mirage-xen`.
* Add a new `Cohttp.Connection` module to manage server's connections identifiers.
* Share the same configuration type for the different server implementations.
* Add `Accept_types` module to the `Cohttp` pack.

0.9.12 (2013-11-28):
* Improve documentation for `Cohttp.Header`.
* Expose Fieldslib setters and getters for most of the `Cohttp` types (#38).
* `Cohttp.Set_cookie.t` is no longer an abstract type to make it easier to update (#38).
* [Lwt] ignore SIGPIPE unconditionally if using the Lwt/Unix module (#37).
* Rename `Cookie` creation parameters for consistency (interface breaking, see #44).
* Fix transfer-length detection (regression from 0.9.11 in #42).
* Add Merin editor file (#41).

0.9.11 (2013-10-27):
* Request module: When sending a request, add the port information in the host header field if available.
* Request module: When parsing a request, add scheme, host and port information in the uri.
* TCP server: When creating the socket for the server, do not force PF_INET6 but take the sockaddr value.

0.9.9 (2013-06-12):
* Disable the mirage executable test as it was building too aggressively and breaking builds.

0.9.8 (2013-05-24):
* Lwt interface change: Rewrite Lwt backends to share code, and remove duplicate function calls from Uri.
* Depend on `Uri` 1.3.8+ as it exposes the parameter query functions now removed from `Request`.
* Do not depend on Cstruct in core library, as only Mirage needs it.
* Remove `Cohttp_async.body` type alias and just use `string Pipe.Reader.t` for more explicit types.

0.9.7 (2013-05-10):
* Attach a GC finaliser to the Lwt client to ensure that even an HTTP body isnt consumed, the socket will eventually be closed (#11).
* Add an Async.Server interface, and revise the Client interface to be more in line with Core standards.
* Add 422 Unprocessable Entity code.
* Refactor modules better across Lwt/Async, but incompatible with earlier releases for Async (Lwt is unchanged at present).

* Add basic cookie support back to the portable library.
* `Cohttp_lwt.Client.post_form` now uses non-chunked encoding for
  the POST instead of chunked.

* If an Lwt callback does not consume a body, ensure it has
  been drained by the API to prevent future pipelines from stalls.
