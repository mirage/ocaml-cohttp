0.9.8 (trunk):
* Depend on `Uri` 1.3.8+ as it exposes the parameter query functions now removed from `Request`.
* Do not depend on Cstruct in core library, as only Mirage needs it.
* Remove `Cohttp_async.body` type alias and just use `string Pipe.Reader.t` for more explicit types.

0.9.7 (2013-05-10):
* Attach a GC finaliser to the Lwt client to ensure that even an HTTP body isnt consumed, the socket will eventually be closed (#11).
* Add an Async.Server interface, and revise the Client interface to be more in line with Core standards.
* Add 422 Unprocessable Entity code.
* Refactor modules better across Lwt/Async, but incompatible with earlier releases for Async (Lwt is unchanged at present).
* Add user agent string and User-Agent header helper function
* The git history of this release is full of adventures in parameterised monads and refactoring, but this isn't in the actual release. Yet.

0.9.6 (2013-03-18):
* Depend on Async (>= 109.12.00), which has an incompatible API with earlier versions.
* Rearrange core library files for `obuild` support.

0.9.5 (2012-12-29):
* Fix cookie parsing to retrieve the correct header.
* Update to `mirage-net` 0.5.0 API (based on cstruct 0.6.0).

0.9.4 (2012-12-19):
* Add Lwt `respond_redirect` and `respond_need_auth` helpers.
* Add enough Basic authorization support to serve a password-protected website.
* Fix Lwt file serving to not throw exception on trying to serve a directory.
* Port Async interface to 108.07.00 or higher (incompatible
  with earlier versions).

0.9.3 (2012-10-27):
* Add basic cookie support back to the portable library.
* `Cohttp_lwt.Client.post_form` now uses non-chunked encoding for
  the POST instead of chunked.
* Various improvements and tests for the pipelined Lwt Client.callv
* If an Lwt callback does not consume a body, ensure it has
  been drained by the API to prevent future pipelines from stalls.
* Fix handling of Lwt server non-empty POST bodies.
* Map the `put` functions to HTTP PUT instead of POST.

0.9.2 (2012-09-20):
* Add Request.get_param to extract a singleton key from queries.
* Fix chunked encoding handling when short reads occur.
* Install HTML documentation for all enabled drivers.
* Use ocaml-uri-1.3.2 interface for query parsing.
* Lwt: Add Server.respond_file and resolve_file for the Unix
  library to make it easier to serve static files.
* Lwt: Server.respond_not_found takes an optional Uri.t now.

0.9.1 (2012-09-11):
* Functorise for Async, Lwt_unix and Mirage.
* Use URI and Re libraries to not need Str any more.
* More robust parsing for various HTTP headers.

0.9.0 (2012-08-01):
* Initial public release.
